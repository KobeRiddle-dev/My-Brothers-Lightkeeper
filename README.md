## About

My Brother's Lightkeeper, a game created for EAE-3720 Alternative Game Development Summer 2024 at the University of Utah.

The sea is an oft-used metaphor for life in the Judaeo-Christian world. A large point of inspiration for the themes and motifs of *My Brother's Lightkeeper* is the Christian hymn *Brightly Beams Our Father's Mercy*, a song about our role as individuals in helping others through the struggles of life. My Brother's Light-Keeper seeks to explore the needs and responsibilities of mortals in a broken world through placing the player in a treacherous sea, where they will be aided in the dark by other light keepers, and presented with opportunities to aide others, as they sail towards a hopeful shore.

```txt
Trim your feeble lamp, my brother; Some poor sailor, tempest-tossed,

Trying now to make the harbor, In the darkness may be lost.

Let the lower lights be burning; Send a gleam across the wave.

Some poor fainting, struggling seaman You may rescue, you may save.
```
